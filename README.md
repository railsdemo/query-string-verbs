## URL Verbs in Query Strings

[Heroku Demo Link](hhttp://query-string-verbs.herokuapp.com/)

*"but I prefer the “?m=share” formulation..., it makes it clear that the page is meant to do something, not just convey more information."* - Aaron Swartz

A demo of URLs that use the following conventions, as propsed by Aaron Swartz in [A Programmable Web, Ch. 2 Building for Users: Designing URLs](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00481ED1V01Y201302WBE005):

1. URLs represent nouns (/locations, /location/1)
2. Verbs should be passed to the noun via query string (/locations?v=new, /location/1?v=edit)

This is a bit strange and I will present two demos objects:

-Locations (Scaffolded)
-Notes (Created from Scratch)
